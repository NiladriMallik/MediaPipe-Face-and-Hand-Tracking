# MediaPipe-Face-and-Hand-Tracking
I have only drawn the facial and hand landmarks with the help of MediaPipe library in Python.

[FaceMesh.py](https://github.com/NiladriMallik/MediaPipe-Face-and-Hand-Tracking/blob/main/FaceMesh.py) detects and tracks the facial landmarks.

[HandTracking.py](https://github.com/NiladriMallik/MediaPipe-Face-and-Hand-Tracking/blob/main/HandTracking.py) detects and tracks the hand landmarks.
